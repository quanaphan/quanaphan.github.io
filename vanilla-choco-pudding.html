            <h1>Flan - The Royalty Amongs Puddings</h1>
            <p id="txtbody">When mentioning the word "pudding" the first sweet that would pop in one's mind is always the Flan, flagship of all puddings</p>
            <p id="txtbody">The Flan is divided into 2 layers: the thick yet silky golden yolk and the bitter sweet caramel layer dripping from the top of the yolk. The combination of these two layers is a miracle in and of itself but missing either one of these will forever make a Flan incomplete.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Make one and try for yourself today!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup of whipping cream</li>
                <li>1 cup of milk (do not use low-fat, that is heresy)</li>
                <li>1 Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise</li>
                <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 large yolks</li>
                <li>7 tablespoons of sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Preperation</h2>
            <p id="txtbody">Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350Â°F. Combine cream, milk and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into cream mixture; add bean. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Meanwhile, combine 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water in another heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high and cook without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Quickly pour caramel into six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Using oven mitts as aid, immediately tilt each ramekin to coat sides. Set ramekins into 13x9x2-inch baking pan.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Whisk eggs, egg yolks and 7 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl just until blended. Gradually and gently whisk cream mixture into egg mixture without creating lots of foam. Pour custard through small sieve into prepared ramekins, dividing evenly (mixture will fill ramekins). Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Bake until centers of flans are gently set, about 40 minutes. Transfer flans to rack and cool. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead.)</p>
            <p id="txtbody">To serve, run small sharp knife around flan to loosen. Turn over onto plate. Shake gently to release flan. Carefully lift off ramekin allowing caramel syrup to run over flan. Repeat with remaining flans and serve.</p>
