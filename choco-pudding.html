            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar (150g)</li>
                <li>3 Tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons natural cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 cups milk (710ml)</li>
                <li>4 oz dark chocolate bar, chopped into small pieces I use 60% dark chocolate (113g)</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons butter cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Homemade Whipped Cream for topping, optional</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Preperation</h2>
            <p id="txtbody">Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350Â°F. Combine cream, milk and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into cream mixture; add bean. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Meanwhile, combine 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water in another heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high and cook without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Quickly pour caramel into six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Using oven mitts as aid, immediately tilt each ramekin to coat sides. Set ramekins into 13x9x2-inch baking pan.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Whisk eggs, egg yolks and 7 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl just until blended. Gradually and gently whisk cream mixture into egg mixture without creating lots of foam. Pour custard through small sieve into prepared ramekins, dividing evenly (mixture will fill ramekins). Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Bake until centers of flans are gently set, about 40 minutes. Transfer flans to rack and cool. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead.)</p>
            <p id="txtbody">To serve, run small sharp knife around flan to loosen. Turn over onto plate. Shake gently to release flan. Carefully lift off ramekin allowing caramel syrup to run over flan. Repeat with remaining flans and serve.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Read through the recipe and prepare and gather all of your ingredients before beginning.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and salt.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Add milk and transfer to stovetop over medium-low heat and whisk ingredients together.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Whisk ingredients frequently on medium heat until ingredients begin to thicken (this will take several minutes).  Do not increase the heat to expedite the process, as it is important that the sugars melt for the pudding to ultimately reach the desired consistency.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Once mixture has thickened (it should be approaching a pudding consistency and be able to coat the back of a spoon so that no metal shows through) whisk constantly, the mixture will come to a boil (again, don't increase heat, this will take several minutes but the mixture will eventually come to a boil) and continue to whisk for 60 seconds (use a timer) before removing from heat (still whisking constantly).</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Immediately add chopped chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Whisk until ingredients are smooth and chocolate and butter are completely melted.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Pour your pudding through a fine mesh sieve (optional, but this will eliminate any lumps) into a medium-sized heatproof bowl. Allow to cool for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent skin from forming.</p>
            <p id="txtbody">Cover the surface of your pudding with clear plastic wrap, making sure that the clear wrap is pressed against the surface of the chocolate to prevent a skin from forming.</p>
            <<p id="txtbody">Refrigerate at least 4 hours to allow pudding to cool completely before serving, topped with homemade whipped cream (if desired).</p>
